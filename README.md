# VFX — Unity Slash Effect

A stylized **slash VFX** created using **Photoshop** for texture work and **Unity’s Particle System** for animation.  
This effect is designed to be lightweight, reusable, and easy to drop into gameplay moments like attacks or ability hits.

## 🎨 Texture Source

This slash texture was hand-painted in Photoshop and used in the particle material.
